# Guided LLM Conversion

This repository includes results from experimentation of using LLMs to convert HTML to MarkDown: trying  different ways to get LLMs to convert in a way that ensures output is as consistent with the user's intended outcome as possible.

## Sections
- [differentPrompts](differentPrompts/README.md) contains results from each prompt and each of the LLMs tested as well as the results from converting longer documents. 
- [guidingWithExamples](guidingWithExamples/README.md) contains results from using a manually edited/converted md file as an example to assist the LLMs in providing "better" results.
